# Augustium WebAssembly Compiler - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

The Augustium WebAssembly Compiler is a compilation target that enables Augustium smart contracts to run in web browsers and JavaScript environments through WebAssembly. This compiler extends the existing Rust-based Augustium compiler infrastructure to generate WASM bytecode, providing seamless integration with web applications and enabling client-side smart contract execution.

The primary goal is to bridge blockchain smart contract development with web technologies, allowing developers to write Augustium contracts that can be executed both on-chain and in browser environments for testing, simulation, and decentralized application development.

## 3. Core Process

### Developer Workflow

1. **Contract Development**: Developer writes Augustium smart contract using existing language features
2. **WASM Compilation**: Developer runs `augustc --target wasm contract.aug` to generate WASM module
3. **JavaScript Integration**: Developer imports generated WASM module into web application
4. **Contract Execution**: Web application instantiates and executes contract methods in browser
5. **Testing & Debugging**: Developer uses browser dev tools and provided debugging utilities

### Build Process Flow

1. **Source Parsing**: Existing lexer and parser process Augustium source code
2. **AST Generation**: Abstract syntax tree created using current AST infrastructure
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking and validation using existing semantic analyzer
4. **WASM Code Generation**: New WASM backend generates WebAssembly instructions
5. **Optimization**: WASM-specific optimizations applied to bytecode
6. **Module Generation**: Final WASM module created with JavaScript bindings
7. **Package Output**: Generated files packaged for distribution

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Architecture Overview

The WASM compiler extends the existing Augustium compiler infrastructure by adding a new compilation target. The implementation leverages Rust's `wasm-pack` toolchain and integrates with the current codegen module.

* **Type System**: WASM-compatible type mappings for Augustium types

* **Runtime**: Minimal WASM runtime for contract execution

### 5.3 Integration Points

* Extends existing `Instruction` enum with WASM-specific operations

* Integrates with current AST and semantic analysis phases

* Utilizes existing error handling and debugging infrastructure

* Maintains compatibility with current ML and blockchain features

## 6. Success Metrics

* **Compilation Speed**: Target <5 seconds for typical smart contracts

* **WASM Size**: Generated modules under 1MB for standard contracts

* **Browser Compatibility**: Support for all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

* **Developer Adoption**: Integration in at least 3 sample DApp projects

* **Performance**: WASM execution within 2x of native Rust performance
